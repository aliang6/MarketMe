## Description
This web application was originally conceived as a "marketing" app, but is still applicable by applying "marketing" to a broad meaning. The idea is to allow a person with a product or service to market to learn the best way to appeal to an online audience.

## Usage
Enter some keywords that apply to what you're pitching in the text box. Then, hit go and see what communities you should be reaching out to and how you should interact with them. 

## The Future
For now, the search applies to Reddit subcommunities, but we hope to expand this to also suggest:
- Other online forums
- Twitter hashtags
- Facebook
- Blogs
- Company/Personal Websites
- Etc

## Tools

Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### APIs and Libraries
Watson, Reddit API, OAuth
